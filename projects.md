## A List of my Projects

- **Hotel Sentiment Analysis - Data Science**

Secondly, it was cleaned and then experiments were conducted to evaluate ammenities' sentiment scores. Some methods were also applied, VADER being the primary method used for sentiment analysis.

- **Time Series - Data Science**  
 Implementation of methods and techniques for forecasting a time series based on two other time series used as exogenous variables.
Throughout this work, the iterations carried out and the approaches adopted to achieve forecasts of residential property prices in Spain are documented. These forecasts were enhanced through the incorporation of exogenous variables, since several external financial factors exert a direct or indirect influence on housing prices.
For this study, multiple time series analysis and forecasting techniques were employed, including variable selection, graphical analysis, data analysis such as outlier detection, stationarity analysis through the application of the ADF and PP tests (unit root tests) and the KPSS stationarity test, the selection and use of ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX models with exogenous variables from series B and C, as well as neural networks with and without fine-tuning, culminating in the analysis of the results.
